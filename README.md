Musical Instrument:
A COLLECTIVE INSTRUMENT CAPTURING BREATHE WITH PAPER WINDMILLS

Cata Sopros is interactive sound installation running on Arduino Uno and created by Elas Duas, the project is a collective musical instrument made with paper windmills transforming the users’ breathe into sounds:

The windmills have inbuilt electret microphones that were connected to an Arduino Uno. The sensor data was then sent to MaxMSP and the sounds were played with Ableton Live. The video was shot at the cloister of the beautiful Alberto Sampaio museum in Guimarães, Portugal.

3 Sensors:

Distance Sensor

The distance sensor measures distance by shining a beam of infrared light and uses a phototransitor to measure the intensity of the light that bounces back. 
The effective distance measuring range for this proximity sensor is 10-80cm.  If an object is closer than the shortest distance, it reports a significantly higher analog output and is inconsistent with expected in-range results. 

Tilt Sensor 
 
A tilt sensor can measure the tilting in often two axes of a reference plane in two axes. In contrast, a full motion would use at least three axes and often additional sensors. One way to measure tilt angle with reference to the earths ground plane, is to use an accelerometer. Typical applications can be found in the industry and in game controllers.

PIR Sensor

A passive infrared sensor (PIR sensor) is an electronic sensor that measures infrared (IR) light radiating from objects in its field of view. They are most often used in PIR-based motion detectors.

1.Music egg carton

Users can use hand movements to feel the sound of eggs, each egg has an especial tone of sound, so that users can notice the different when interacting the egg carton. By using PIR sensor and put a LED inside the egg, when a hand pass through it, the egg will be brighter and the produce a sound.

2. By using the RGB color sensor, different color of balloon has an especial sound, users can by touching different color of balloon to create a song.
