Musical Instrument:
A COLLECTIVE INSTRUMENT CAPTURING BREATHE WITH PAPER WINDMILLS

Cata Sopros is interactive sound installation running on Arduino Uno and created by Elas Duas, the project is a collective musical instrument made with paper windmills transforming the users’ breathe into sounds:

The windmills have inbuilt electret microphones that were connected to an Arduino Uno. The sensor data was then sent to MaxMSP and the sounds were played with Ableton Live. The video was shot at the cloister of the beautiful Alberto Sampaio museum in Guimarães, Portugal.
