Musical Instrument:
A COLLECTIVE INSTRUMENT CAPTURING BREATHE WITH PAPER WINDMILLS

Cata Sopros is interactive sound installation running on Arduino Uno and created by Elas Duas, the project is a collective musical instrument made with paper windmills transforming the users’ breathe into sounds:

The windmills have inbuilt electret microphones that were connected to an Arduino Uno. The sensor data was then sent to MaxMSP and the sounds were played with Ableton Live. The video was shot at the cloister of the beautiful Alberto Sampaio museum in Guimarães, Portugal.

Sensors:
Distance Sensor
The SHARP 2Y0A21 proximity sensor measures distance by shining a beam of infrared light and uses a phototransitor to measure the intensity of the light that bounces back. 
The effective distance measuring range for this proximity sensor is 10-80cm.  If an object is closer than the shortest distance, it reports a significantly higher analog output and is inconsistent with expected in-range results.
