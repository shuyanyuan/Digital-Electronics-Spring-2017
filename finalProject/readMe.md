Final project

Proposal
For the final project, I wanted to create an installation that is used physical input and output instead of screen based visual output.
After the idea brainstorming, I came up an idea to create a lit bomb object, the flames will be keep sparkling and flashing, in order to extinguish the flames, people can use the real action in reality to blow out the flame. The bomb and the sparkle is a metaphor and signifier to indicate people use the blow a flame action to interact with the installation.

Materials Used
FLORA - for minimaling the components and eventually get rid of a computer and breadbords
Neopixel strip - to represent the flame, program and connect to the sensor
Electret microphone (100Hzâ€“10kHz) Amplifier - detect the analog sound input to control the neopixel
El wire- flexible to make a bomb sharpe
Laser cut- use AI to draw the outline and frame and laser cut it
Soldering- solder the piecemeal neopixels together
